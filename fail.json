During this period, there was no operating system as we understand it today; instead, users acted as both programmers and operators. They would write code, load it into the machines, and maintain the hardware. Computers of this era could only run a single application program at a time, and programming was done using physical plugboards where wiring instructions represented the programs【source_1】."
